## 2. Problem Context

### 2.1 Current State Analysis

India's civic infrastructure complaint management systems face critical challenges:

- **Fragmentation**: Multiple disconnected systems across municipalities with no centralized intelligence or data sharing.
- **Reactive Governance**: Authorities respond to complaints after they escalate, lacking predictive indicators for proactive intervention.
- **Language Barriers**: Existing systems primarily support English and Hindi, excluding citizens who speak other regional languages.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Citizens have limited visibility into resolution progress, leading to distrust and repeated complaints.
- **No Analytics**: Raw complaint data is not transformed into actionable insights, risk indicators, or trend analysis.
- **Poor Accountability**: No structured mechanism to verify resolution quality or allow citizens to dispute inadequate fixes.

### 2.2 Impact of Current Problems

- Delayed infrastructure repairs leading to safety hazards
- Citizen frustration and reduced civic engagement
- Inefficient resource allocation by government departments
- Inability to identify and prioritize high-risk areas
- Lack of data-driven decision making for urban planning

### 2.3 Target Users

**Primary Users**:

- **Citizens**: Report issues, track status, reopen if unresolved
- **Government Officers**: Resolve issues, upload proof, manage workload
- **Administrators**: Generate reports, manage users, monitor system health

**Secondary Users**:

- **Policy Makers**: Access analytics and reports for decision making
- **Urban Planners**: Use historical data for infrastructure planning
- **Public**: View aggregated statistics and reports

## 3. Solution Overview

### 3.1 Proposed Solution

FixIt Hub is a cloud-native, AI-powered civic intelligence platform that:

1. **Centralizes** all civic infrastructure complaints in a single system
2. **Democratizes** participation through multilingual support (22+ Indian languages)
3. **Automates** issue classification and translation using AI
4. **Transforms** raw complaints into structured analytics and risk indicators
5. **Enables** transparent resolution tracking with proof-based verification
6. **Empowers** citizens with controlled reopen capabilities
7. **Generates** executive-ready AI summaries for decision makers
8. **Scales** nationally using AWS cloud infrastructure

### 3.2 Key Innovations

> - **AI-Powered Multilingual Processing**: Breaks language barriers for inclusive participation
> - **Predictive Risk Scoring**: Identifies emerging infrastructure stress zones before critical failure
> - **Controlled Transparency**: Balances citizen accountability with spam prevention
> - **Executive Intelligence**: Transforms data into actionable insights for governance
> - **Proof-Based Resolution**: Ensures accountability and quality of fixes

### 3.3 Technology Foundation

> - **Frontend**: React + Vite for responsive web interface
> - **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for high-performance API layer
> - **Database**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL for structured data
> - **Storage**: AWS S3 for images and documents
> - **AI**: Amazon Bedrock or external AI APIs for intelligent processing
> - **Infrastructure**: AWS cloud-native architecture with auto-scaling

## 22. Appendix D: Risk Score Calculation Example

**Example Ward: Ward 23 - Koramangala**

**Component Calculations:**

1. **Repeated Reports Score (R)**:
   - Issues within 1km radius in last 30 days: 35
   - Normalized: (35 / 50) × 100 = 70

2. **Time Unresolved Score (T)**:
   - Average days open: 18 days
   - Normalized: (18 / 30) × 100 = 60

3. **Growth Rate Score (G)**:
   - Current week: 25 issues
   - Previous week: 18 issues
   - Growth: ((25-18)/18) × 100 = 38.9%
   - Normalized: 38.9 × 2 = 77.8

4. **Severity Score (S)**:
   - 10 water issues (weight 1.0)
   - 8 electrical (weight 0.9)
   - 5 pothole (weight 0.7)
   - Weighted average: ((10×1.0 + 8×0.9 + 5×0.7) / 23) × 100 = 82.6

**Final Risk Score:**
```
Risk Score = (0.35 × 70) + (0.30 × 60) + (0.25 × 77.8) + (0.10 × 82.6)
           = 24.5 + 18 + 19.45 + 8.26
           = 70.21
```

**Classification**: HIGH (50-75 range)
