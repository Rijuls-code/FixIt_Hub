# 🌍 FixIt Hub  
## AI-Powered Civic Intelligence Platform

FixIt Hub is a web-based civic intelligence platform that enables citizens to report public infrastructure issues and helps government authorities respond with transparency, accountability, and data-driven prioritization.

The system transforms scattered civic complaints into structured analytics and predictive risk indicators using AI.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Civic issue reporting in India is:

- Fragmented across platforms  
- Reactive instead of proactive  
- Limited by language barriers  
- Lacking structured analytics  
- Weak in accountability tracking  

Municipalities often respond only after issues escalate, without early warning systems or risk-based prioritization.

---

## 💡 Solution

FixIt Hub centralizes civic issue reporting and enhances it with AI-driven intelligence.

The platform:

- Accepts multilingual issue submissions  
- Automatically translates and classifies issues  
- Tracks resolution with proof-based verification  
- Allows controlled citizen reopen (max 2 times, 36-hour cooldown)  
- Calculates ward-level predictive risk scores  
- Generates AI-powered weekly executive summaries  

This enables proactive governance instead of reactive complaint handling.
