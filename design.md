CREATE INDEX idx_issues_location ON issues(latitude, longitude);
```

### 4.3 Resolution & Reopen Control Module

#### 4.3.1 Resolution Process

**Officer Actions**:

1. View assigned issues in dashboard
2. Update status to IN_PROGRESS
3. Complete resolution work
4. Upload proof photo (before/after comparison)
5. Add resolution notes
6. Mark as RESOLVED

**Backend Validation**:

- Proof photo required (enforced)
- Resolution notes minimum 20 characters
- Timestamp recorded
- Citizen notification triggered

#### 4.3.2 Reopen Logic

**Citizen Reopen Rights**:

- Can reopen RESOLVED issues
- Maximum 2 reopens per issue
- 36-hour cooldown between consecutive reopens
- Must provide reopen reason (min 50 chars)

**Business Rules**:
```python
def can_reopen(issue):
    if issue.reopen_count >= 2:
        return False, "Maximum reopen limit reached"
    
    if issue.last_reopened_at:
        hours_since_reopen = (now() - issue.last_reopened_at).total_seconds() / 3600
        if hours_since_reopen < 36:
            return False, f"Cooldown active. Wait {36 - hours_since_reopen:.1f} hours"
    
    if issue.status != 'RESOLVED':
        return False, "Only resolved issues can be reopened"
    
    return True, "Reopen allowed"
```

#### 4.3.3 Transparency Features

- Full resolution history visible to citizen
- All previous resolution attempts displayed
- Proof photos accessible
- Officer notes visible
- Reopen reasons logged

#### 4.3.4 Database Updates

```sql
-- Add resolution history tracking
CREATE TABLE resolution_history (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    issue_id UUID REFERENCES issues(id),
    resolved_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    proof_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    reopened BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    reopen_reason TEXT,
    reopened_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_resolution_history_issue ON resolution_history(issue_id);
```

### 4.4 AI Processing Module

#### 4.4.1 Multilingual Translation

**Supported Languages**: Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada, Odia, Malayalam, Punjabi, Assamese, Maithili, Sanskrit, Konkani, Nepali, Sindhi, Dogri, Kashmiri, Manipuri, Bodo, Santali, English

**Translation Flow**:

1. Detect source language from user input
2. Send to AI model with prompt:
```
Translate the following civic complaint from {source_lang} to English.
Preserve technical terms and location names.

Original: {description}
```

3. Store translated text in `description_translated` field
4. Fallback: If AI fails, store original text

#### 4.4.2 Automatic Classification

**Categories**:

- Pothole
- Garbage/Waste Management
- Water Leakage/Supply
- Electrical/Streetlight
- Road Damage
- Drainage/Sewage
- Other

**Classification Prompt**:
```json
{
  "task": "classify_civic_issue",
  "description": "{translated_description}",
  "title": "{title}",
  "categories": ["pothole", "garbage", "water", "electrical", "road", "drainage", "other"],
  "output_format": {
    "category": "string",
    "confidence": "float (0-1)"
  }
}
```

**Confidence Handling**:

- Confidence > 0.8: Auto-assign category
- Confidence 0.5-0.8: Suggest to officer for confirmation
- Confidence < 0.5: Mark as "Other", require manual classification

#### 4.4.3 Weekly Executive Summary Generation

**Input Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "week_start": "2026-02-09",
  "week_end": "2026-02-15",
  "total_issues": 1247,
  "resolved_issues": 892,
  "open_issues": 355,
  "growth_rate": 12.5,
  "avg_resolution_time_hours": 48.3,
  "top_category": "pothole",
  "top_ward": "Ward 23 - Koramangala",
  "high_risk_zones": [
    {"ward": "Ward 23", "risk_score": 87.5},
    {"ward": "Ward 15", "risk_score": 76.2}
  ],
  "category_breakdown": {
    "pothole": 456,
    "garbage": 312,
    "water": 189
  }
}
```

**AI Prompt**:
```
You are a civic intelligence analyst. Generate a concise executive summary 
for government officials based on the following weekly civic issue data.

Focus on:
1. Key trends and changes
2. Areas requiring immediate attention
3. Performance metrics
4. Actionable recommendations

Data: {json_data}

Generate a 200-300 word executive summary in professional tone.
```

#### 4.4.4 Fallback Handling

**AI Service Failure Strategy**:

1. Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
2. If translation fails: Store original text, flag for manual review
3. If classification fails: Assign "Other" category
4. If summary fails: Generate template-based summary
5. Log all failures to CloudWatch for monitoring

**Error Logging**:
```python
logger.error(
    "AI processing failed",
    extra={
        "issue_id": issue_id,
        "operation": "translation",
        "error": str(e),
        "retry_count": retry_count
    }
)
```

### 4.5 Analytics & Risk Scoring Module

#### 4.5.1 Risk Score Formula

**Mathematical Model**:
```
Risk Score = (w1 × R) + (w2 × T) + (w3 × G) + (w4 × S)

Where:
R = Repeated Reports Score (0-100)
T = Time Unresolved Score (0-100)
G = Growth Rate Score (0-100)
S = Severity Score (0-100)

Weights (tunable):
w1 = 0.35 (repeated reports)
w2 = 0.30 (time factor)
w3 = 0.25 (growth rate)
w4 = 0.10 (severity)
```

#### 4.5.2 Component Calculations

**Repeated Reports Score (R)**:
```python
def calculate_repeated_reports_score(ward, radius_km=1.0):
    # Count issues within radius in last 30 days
    cluster_count = count_issues_in_radius(ward, radius_km, days=30)
    
    # Normalize to 0-100
    max_threshold = 50  # 50+ issues = max score
    return min(100, (cluster_count / max_threshold) * 100)
```

**Time Unresolved Score (T)**:
```python
def calculate_time_score(ward):
    open_issues = get_open_issues(ward)
    
    if not open_issues:
        return 0
    
    avg_days_open = sum(
        (now() - issue.created_at).days for issue in open_issues
    ) / len(open_issues)
    
    # Normalize: 30+ days = max score
    return min(100, (avg_days_open / 30) * 100)
```

**Growth Rate Score (G)**:
```python
def calculate_growth_score(ward):
    current_week_count = count_issues(ward, weeks=1)
    previous_week_count = count_issues(ward, weeks=2, offset=1)
    
    if previous_week_count == 0:
        return 0
    
    growth_rate = ((current_week_count - previous_week_count) / previous_week_count) * 100
    
    # Normalize: 50%+ growth = max score
    return min(100, max(0, growth_rate * 2))
```

**Severity Score (S)**:
```python
def calculate_severity_score(ward):
    # Weight categories by severity
    severity_weights = {
        'water': 1.0,      # Critical
        'electrical': 0.9,
        'drainage': 0.8,
        'pothole': 0.7,
        'road': 0.6,
        'garbage': 0.5,
        'other': 0.3
    }
    
    issues = get_open_issues(ward)
    weighted_sum = sum(severity_weights.get(issue.category, 0.5) for issue in issues)
    
    # Normalize
    return min(100, (weighted_sum / len(issues)) * 100) if issues else 0
```

#### 4.5.3 Risk Classification

```python
def classify_risk(risk_score):
    if risk_score >= 75:
        return "CRITICAL", "red"
    elif risk_score >= 50:
        return "HIGH", "orange"
    elif risk_score >= 25:
        return "MEDIUM", "yellow"
    else:
        return "LOW", "green"
```

#### 4.5.4 Weekly Aggregation Queries

```sql
-- Weekly statistics by ward
SELECT 
    ward,
    COUNT(*) as total_issues,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'RESOLVED') as resolved_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status IN ('OPEN', 'IN_PROGRESS')) as open_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (resolved_at - created_at))/3600) as avg_resolution_hours,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE reopen_count > 0) as reopened_count
FROM issues
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY ward
ORDER BY total_issues DESC;

-- Category breakdown
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM issues
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Growth rate calculation
WITH current_week AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM issues 
    WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
),
previous_week AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM issues 
    WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '14 days' 
    AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
)
SELECT 
    current_week.count as current,
    previous_week.count as previous,
    ROUND(((current_week.count - previous_week.count) * 100.0 / NULLIF(previous_week.count, 0)), 2) as growth_rate
FROM current_week, previous_week;
```

### 5.3 Database Optimization Strategies

#### 5.3.1 Indexing Strategy

- B-tree indexes on frequently queried columns (status, category, ward)
- Composite index on (latitude, longitude) for geospatial queries
- Partial indexes for active issues: `CREATE INDEX idx_active_issues ON issues(created_at) WHERE status IN ('OPEN', 'IN_PROGRESS')`

#### 5.3.2 Partitioning (Future)

- Partition `issues` table by created_at (monthly partitions)
- Partition `audit_logs` by created_at (weekly partitions)
- Improves query performance for time-range queries

#### 5.3.3 Connection Pooling

- Use PgBouncer or SQLAlchemy connection pool
- Pool size: 20-50 connections
- Max overflow: 10 connections
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds

**Permission Matrix**:

| Action | Citizen | Officer | Admin |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Report Issue | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| View Own Issues | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| View All Issues | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Resolve Issue | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Reopen Issue | ✓ (own) | ✗ | ✓ |
| View Analytics | Limited | ✓ | ✓ |
| Generate Reports | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Manage Users | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |

### 7.2 Input Validation

#### 7.2.1 Backend Validation (Pydantic)

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator

class IssueCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str = Field(..., min_length=10, max_length=200)
    description: str = Field(..., min_length=20, max_length=2000)
    latitude: float = Field(..., ge=-90, le=90)
    longitude: float = Field(..., ge=-180, le=180)
    language: str = Field(..., regex="^[a-z]{2}$")
    
    @validator('title', 'description')
    def sanitize_text(cls, v):
        # Remove potentially harmful characters
        return v.strip()
```

#### 7.2.2 File Upload Validation

- **Allowed Types**: JPEG, PNG only
- **Max Size**: 5MB per image
- **Virus Scanning**: ClamAV integration (optional)
- **Image Processing**: Resize to max 1920x1080, strip EXIF data

### 7.3 Rate Limiting

**Limits by Endpoint**:

- Authentication: 5 requests/minute
- Issue Creation: 10 requests/hour per user
- Issue Listing: 100 requests/minute
- Analytics: 50 requests/minute
- Report Generation: 1 request/hour (admin only)

**Implementation**: Redis-based token bucket algorithm

### 7.4 Data Privacy & Compliance

#### 7.4.1 Personal Data Protection

- **PII Encryption**: Sensitive fields encrypted at rest
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary information
- **Right to Deletion**: Users can request account deletion
- **Data Retention**: Issues retained for 5 years, then archived

#### 7.4.2 Audit Logging

All sensitive operations logged:

- User authentication attempts
- Issue status changes
- Resolution actions
- Report generation
- Admin actions

### 7.5 Scalability Considerations

#### 7.5.1 Horizontal Scaling

- **Backend**: Stateless FastAPI instances behind load balancer
- **Database**: Read replicas for analytics queries
- **Storage**: S3 auto-scales
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and rate limiting

#### 7.5.2 Performance Targets

- **API Response Time**: < 200ms (p95)
- **Page Load Time**: < 2 seconds
- **Image Upload**: < 5 seconds
- **Report Generation**: < 30 seconds
- **Concurrent Users**: 10,000+

#### 7.5.3 Caching Strategy

- **CDN**: CloudFront for static assets
- **API Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data
  - Issue listings: 5 minute TTL
  - Statistics: 15 minute TTL
  - Weekly reports: 1 hour TTL
- **Database Query Caching**: PostgreSQL query result cache

### 7.6 Fault Tolerance

#### 7.6.1 High Availability

- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: RDS and EC2 across availability zones
- **Auto-Scaling**: EC2 Auto Scaling Groups
- **Health Checks**: ALB health checks every 30 seconds
- **Failover**: Automatic RDS failover < 2 minutes

#### 7.6.2 Backup & Recovery

- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups, 7-day retention
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: 5-minute granularity
- **S3 Versioning**: Enabled for all buckets
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region replication (optional)

#### 7.6.3 Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: System remains functional if AI service fails
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Template-based responses when AI unavailable

### 7.7 Monitoring & Logging

#### 7.7.1 CloudWatch Metrics

- **Application Metrics**:
  - Request count and latency
  - Error rates by endpoint
  - AI processing success rate
  - Database connection pool usage

- **Infrastructure Metrics**:
  - CPU and memory utilization
  - Network throughput
  - Disk I/O
  - RDS performance insights

#### 7.7.2 Alerting

- **Critical Alerts** (PagerDuty/SNS):
  - API error rate > 5%
  - Database connection failures
  - S3 upload failures > 10%
  - AI service unavailable > 5 minutes

- **Warning Alerts** (Email):
  - High response times (> 500ms)
  - Disk usage > 80%
  - Unusual traffic patterns

#### 7.7.3 Structured Logging

```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

logger.info(
    "issue_created",
    issue_id=issue.id,
    user_id=user.id,
    category=issue.category,
    ward=issue.ward,
    processing_time_ms=elapsed_ms
)
```

## 8. Deployment Design

### 8.1 Infrastructure as Code

#### 8.1.1 AWS CloudFormation / Terraform

Define infrastructure as code for reproducible deployments:

```hcl
# Example Terraform structure
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

resource "aws_rds_instance" "postgres" {
  engine               = "postgres"
